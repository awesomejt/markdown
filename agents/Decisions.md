# Decisions

Accepted decisions only. Proposed ideas remain in design documents until an
owner or the named project gate accepts them.

## D-001 — Separate native repository

**Date:** 2026-10-24  
**Status:** accepted by repository creation

The native application lives in `markdown`. `markdown-viewer` remains an
independent LAN web application and behavior reference. The native project may
copy versioned fixtures/contracts with provenance but has no sibling-path build
or runtime dependency.

## D-002 — Recovery-safe local project state

**Date:** 2026-10-24  
**Status:** accepted for planning

Operational task/pass state uses the local `project-state/v1` file
`project.yaml`, stored as readable block YAML and mutated atomically through
`tools/project_state.py`. `TODO.md` explains the roadmap; `MEMORY.md` and this
file store durable context and decisions. Concurrency begins at one active
pass.

## D-003 — Desktop-first platform scope

**Date:** 2026-10-24  
**Status:** accepted from owner clarification

Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop applications are the first delivery family.
iOS and iPadOS follow after the desktop core and behavior contracts mature.
Each platform is optimized independently and may have documented capability
differences. Requirements and functionality from `markdown-viewer` are the
starting point; existing implementation code is not a reuse requirement.

## D-004 — One native monorepo

**Date:** 2026-10-24  
**Status:** accepted by owner

Keep the native platform family in one repository with independent application
trees for Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS/iPadOS. Share requirements, semantic
contracts, fixtures, benchmarks, and only the core code proven useful across
platforms. Do not share the UI layer. Reconsider a split only when ownership,
release governance, licensing, repository scale, or platform divergence makes
atomic cross-platform changes a liability.

## Proposed decisions for GATE-001

The following are not yet accepted:

- Rust or C++ semantic core with platform-native desktop presentation.
- No general-purpose WebView for the main document surface.
- Windows, macOS, and Linux framework/language choices after measured spikes.
- Tier 1 excludes Mermaid and D2 unless FEAS-005 proves a safe offline path.
